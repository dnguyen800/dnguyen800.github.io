        <p>This site is about

  	  <p><strong>To build a complete smart home, nearly every device needs to talk to each other.</strong> 
	  I found a set of products that does just that.</p>

	  <p><strong>I have personally tested each product to see how well they integrate.</strong> Some are great, while others just work. 
	  I'll continue to update my recommendations as new products are released.</p>
	  
	  <p>The content on this site is my own personal, and independent opinion.</p>
