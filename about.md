        <h1>About this site</h1>
</header>

When I first started dabbling with home automation, it was a struggle to find the right information at my level.  I read through forums and blogs riddled with ads and content that read more like product press releases, but I didn't learn much from those sites, except that there has to be a better way to introduce people to home automation.

Based on my terrible experience, I created this website to :

- Get more people interested in home automation 
- Help newcomers understand the possibilities of home automation (it's more than voice commands)
- Share my integrated home automation solution to show what works and what doesn't

This website is free of advertisements--I'm not here to make a living off my site, but to share interesting or helpful information. The content on this site is my own personal, and independent opinion. All products listed were purchased by me unless otherwise stated. I added Amazon affiliate links, though the links do not influence my opinion in any way.

      </header>
      <p>My name is Dan, and I am not a web developer or software engineer, though I wish I was paid like one! I am a thirty-something year old with experience in compliance, risk and process audits of all types. I started my career as an IT auditor at PriceWaterhouseCoopers and worked for several large tech companies within the SOX and internal audit teams. I am looking to branch out in the information security space, where I currently spend my free time learning the tools of the trade.</p>
      <p class="box"><b>CERTIFICATIONS:</b> Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA), (ISC)2 Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP), Certified Public Accountant (CPA, Inactive)</p>
      <p>I am an avid learner of technology, and for the most part, everything I've learned is self-taught. Exploring home automation has given me the opportunity to learn a new set of skills such as Python and Javascript programming, Liquid templating, and become more familiar with OS and server management (Linux, Docker), website design (CSS/HTML), and network security.  I've contributed Python components and Javascript-based UI cards to the Home Assistant open-source community, which you can find on my <a href="{{ site.github_url }}">Github page</a>.</p>

# About this installation

**Dwinnn Speaks** is designed, developed, and maintained by Dan Nguyen. The site is hosted on **Github Pages** and is built with the **Jekyll platform**. I chose Jekyll as my website platform mainly for the challenge (documentation for advanced Jekyll topics is rare) of building a customized site. I didn't want this site to look like another Wordpress blog.

This site would not exist as it is today without the contributions from the Jekyll community (they offer some amazing free themes) and the photographers who provide royalty-free images on the website [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). I've used the resources listed below to create this site.
