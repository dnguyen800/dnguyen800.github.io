I do not own a robot vacuum, but I did watch an informative video review that explained the features found in different price tiered vacuums. I would definitely spend the money to purchase a vacuum with some form of smart navigation (cameras, lasers) that can map out the room virtually. Without it, the vacuum will bounce around walls and tables aimlessly until it gets stuck.
